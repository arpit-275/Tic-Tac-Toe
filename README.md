2. Responsive design, can be played on any device.
3. Choose your own marker (X/O).
4. 3 difficulty levels for playing against AI.
5. Strip message animation.

Difficulty Levels (AI):

1. Easy: AI randomly selects an empty spot on the board.
2. Medium: Minimax algorithm with 50% randomness. AI can choose a random spot with 50% probability.
